# Exam Analysis Script (Python)

## Good To Know Beforehand
* This script requires a ".csv" file to run (refer to demoFile.csv for formatting exam data)
    - In Google Sheets: File > Download as > .csv
* This script requires "numpy" package
    For python 3:
    - sudo apt install python3-pip
    - pip3 install numpy
* There is a formatting problem that occurs when downloading the .csv file from Google Sheets, then opening it in Excel.
     - Workaround: We reccomend just using Google Sheets since we have tested our script with it.

## How to run demo file
* In terminal: python examAnalysis.py demoFile.csv
* demoFile_results.csv should be generated in same folder
